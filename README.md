How to Use It:
Paste into any HTML editor (or CodePen, JSFiddle, or mobile editor like StackBlitz).

Or save as umrah-checklist.html and open it on any mobile browser.

You can also turn this into a progressive web app (PWA) or add checkmark-saving logic if needed.

Would you like me to export this as a downloadable .zip file or enhance it with dark mode/audio/Talbiyah?
